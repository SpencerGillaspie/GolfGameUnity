# GolfGameUnity

This is my first Unity project. It is a 2D "game" where a player is in a grass box. There is a player, a golf ball, and a golf flag. The only interactable component is the ball. The user can click on the ball, hold the mouse button down, and release it in the direction the player desires the ball to move.

The player sprite has no controls and there is no winning state when the ball gets close to the hole.
